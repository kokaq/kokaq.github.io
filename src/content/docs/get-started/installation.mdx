### What is kokaq?

`kokaq` is an open source, distributed, cloud-native priority queue implementation, designed to solve 
the long-standing gap of native priority handling in cloud messaging systems. It’s built for high 
availability, low latency, and intelligent resource allocation — empowering mission-critical workflows 
with dynamic, weight-based prioritization.
