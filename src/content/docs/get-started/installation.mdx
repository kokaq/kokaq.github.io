### What is kokaq?

`kokaq` is an open source, distributed, cloud-native priority queue implementation, designed to solve 
the long-standing gap of native priority handling in cloud messaging systems. Itâ€™s built for high 
availability, low latency, and intelligent resource allocation â€” empowering mission-critical workflows 
with dynamic, weight-based prioritization.

### ðŸš€ Key Features

- **Native Priority Queue Support**  
  Prioritize tasks and messages based on their true importance â€” no workarounds or consumer hacks required.

- **Non-Discrete Priorities**  
  Fine-grained control using continuous, weight-based priority values instead of fixed levels.

- **Cloud-Native Architecture**  
  Built from the ground up on kubernetes and other modern cloud environments, leveraging serverless and container-native workflows.

- **Low Latency & High Availability**  
  Designed to handle latency-sensitive and real-time workloads with minimal delay and strong reliability.

- **Strict Highest-Priority-First Model**  
  Ensures that the most important messages are always processed first, deterministically.

- **SLA-Aware Resource Efficiency**  
  Prevents resource waste by adjusting queue behavior based on time-bound message SLAs.

- **Observability and Insights**  
  Built-in support for real-time monitoring through open telemetry.

- **Service Integration Ready**  
  Seamlessly connects with Azure Functions, AWS Lambda, Cloud Functions


### ðŸ’¡ Why `kokaq`?

Cloud native message queue services donâ€™t support real priority queues. `kokaq` introduces first-class support for prioritization, non-discrete weights, SLA-driven scheduling, and high-performance task routing â€” all without relying on multiple queues or consumer juggling.

#### ðŸ›  Use Cases

- Real-time job processing with strict SLA guarantees
- Scheduling ML inference jobs by impact/urgency
- Event processing with dynamic business priority
- Smart prioritization in CI/CD or build pipelines
- Financial transaction routing or alerting
